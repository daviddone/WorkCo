In a surprising reversal, a Wisconsin board has voted to again offer insurance coverage to transgender state employees seeking hormone therapy and gender confirmation surgery.
在一次令人惊讶的逆转中，威斯康星州董事会投票决定再次为寻求激素治疗和性别确认手术的跨性别州员工提供保险。

Members of the Group Insurance Board, which manages the insurance program for Wisconsin's public workers and retirees, last week voted 5-4 to overturn its current policy barring treatments and procedures "related to gender reassignment or sexual transformation."
管理威斯康星州公共工作人员和退休人员保险计划的集团保险委员会成员上周以5比4投票推翻其目前的政策，禁止“与性别重新分配或性转变有关的治疗和程序”。

The change will take effect Jan. 1, allowing insurance to defray the cost of care deemed medically necessary.
该变更将于1月1日生效，允许保险支付医疗必需的护理费用。

"This was an empowering moment, offering up hope things can get better," Wren Logan, a trans woman and psychiatry resident at UW Health, who fought the policy, wrote in an email.
“这是一个赋权的时刻，提供希望事情可以变得更好，”WW Logan，一位反对该政策的UW Health的跨性别女人和精神病学居民，在一封电子邮件中写道。

The board's decision comes less than a month after NPR and Kaiser Health News ran a story about another 24-year-old trans woman, Wren Vetens, who fought to get her gender confirmation surgery covered after the Group Insurance Board's initial decision left her without insurance coverage. That story was part of the Bill of the Month series.
董事会的决定是在NPR和凯撒健康新闻报道另一位24岁的跨性别女人Wren Vetens之后不到一个月的决定，她在集体保险委员会的初步决定让她没有保险后为争取她的性别确认手术而奋斗。覆盖。那个故事是“月度法案”系列的一部分。

Restrictions had been in place barring trans patients from obtaining coverage since February 2017. This reversed an earlier decision, made two years ago, when the board opted to pay for such expenses for the first time.
自2017年2月以来，禁止跨性别患者获得保险的限制已经到位。这扭转了两年前董事会选择首次支付此类费用的早先决定。

This was shortly after the Obama administration unveiled a rule in May 2016 prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity, and the board was advised that refusing to cover certain treatments for trans patients could run afoul of that rule. Members voted unanimously in July 2016 for the change.
这是在奥巴马政府于2016年5月公布了一项禁止基于性别认同的歧视的规则之后不久，董事会被告知，拒绝为某些跨性别患者提供某些治疗可能会违反该规则。成员于2016年7月一致投票通过了变更。

State officials soon began pressuring the board to not cover these services, despite the Obama administration's directive. About the same time, Wisconsin's justice department joined a lawsuit challenging the anti-discrimination rule.
尽管有奥巴马政府的指示，国家官员很快就开始向董事会施加压力，要求他们不要承担这些服务。大约在同一时间，威斯康星州的司法部门加入了一项挑战反歧视规则的诉讼。

The board voted to reinstate the restrictive policy should a handful of conditions be met — one of which was a court decision to halt the rule. By coincidence, that ruling came the following day. A month later, in February 2017, the restrictions took effect once more.
如果满足少数条件，董事会投票决定恢复限制性政策 - 其中之一是法院决定停止该规则。巧合的是，那个裁决是在第二天发生的。一个月后，即2017年2月，这些限制再次生效。

Shifting Federal Policies Threaten Health Coverage For Trans Americans
改变联邦政策威胁跨性别美国人的健康保险
In a recent memo to the board, a state health policy adviser noted the "legal landscape" had changed, broadening protections for the transgender community. Last month, a federal judge ordered Wisconsin to pay for gender confirmation surgery for two individuals on Medicaid, who sought coverage to treat their gender dysphoria.
在最近的董事会备忘录中，一位州卫生政策顾问指出，“法律环境”发生了变化，扩大了对跨性别社区的保护。上个月，一名联邦法官命令威斯康星州为医疗补助计划中的两个人支付性别确认手术费用，后者寻求保险以治疗他们的性别不安。

Gender dysphoria is the diagnosis for those with "significant distress" due to the difference between their gender and sex, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
根据美国精神病学协会（American Psychiatric Association）的数据，性别不安是由于性别和性别之间存在差异而导致“重大痛苦”的人的诊断。

In another case, two transgender women employed by the University of Wisconsin and covered by the state insurance program have sued the Group Insurance Board and the university's board of regents, among others, accusing them of discrimination based on their inability to get coverage for gender confirmation surgery. The case is scheduled to go to trial in October, before the same judge who ruled in favor of the patients on Medicaid.
在另一个案例中，威斯康星大学雇用并受国家保险计划保护的两名跨性别女人起诉集团保险委员会和大学董事会等，指责他们因无法获得性别确认保险而受到歧视。手术。该案件定于10月份进入审判阶段，由同一位法官在医疗补助计划中支持患者。

Officials from the University of Wisconsin — as well as UnitedHealthcare, which is opening a Medicare Advantage program for Wisconsin's public employees and retirees — have also raised concerns about the policy.
威斯康星大学的官员以及为威斯康星州的公共雇员和退休人员开设医疗保险优惠计划的UnitedHealthcare也对该政策表示担忧。

The decision comes amid speculation that the Trump administration will soon unveil a new rule formally overturning the Obama-era anti-discrimination rule.
这一决定是在市场猜测特朗普政府将很快公布一项正式推翻奥巴马时代反歧视规则的新规定之后做出的。
